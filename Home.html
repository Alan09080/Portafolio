                    ðŸ–¥ðŸ’» I am a student of computer systems engineering at the
                    National
                    Polytechnic Institute, passionate about technology and
                    innovation. I
                    consider myself a proactive, creative, and committed person
                    with a
                    constant learning mindset. I always seek to stay up-to-date
                    with the
                    latest trends and tools in the market, which has led me to
                    have
                    technical skills in areas such as programming, data
                    analysis, and
                    project management. In addition, I have experience in
                    teamwork and
                    communication skills, which has allowed me to successfully
                    collaborate
                    on multidisciplinary projects. I am results-oriented and
                    have an
                    analytical mindset, which enables me to find effective
                    solutions to the
                    problems that arise. In summary, my goal is to develop as a
                    professional
                    in the field of computer systems engineering and contribute
                    to the
                    growth and success of the organizations I work for.
